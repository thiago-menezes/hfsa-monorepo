# HFSA Design System

Welcome to the **HFSA Design System** Storybook!

This is a comprehensive collection of reusable UI components built for the HFSA (Hybrid Feature Scope Architecture) monorepo.

## What's Inside

Our design system includes:

- **ðŸŽ¨ Components**: Reusable React components following design best practices
- **ðŸ“š Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API documentation
- **ðŸ”§ Utilities**: Helper functions and TypeScript types
- **ðŸŽ¯ Accessibility**: A11y-compliant components with proper ARIA support

## Getting Started

Browse the sidebar to explore our components:

1. **Button** - Primary actions and navigation with icon support

3. **Heading** - Typography headings with semantic HTML
4. **Input** - Form inputs with validation
5. **Select** - Dropdown selections
6. **Text** - Typography text with various styles and colors

## Design Principles
